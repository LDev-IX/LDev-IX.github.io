# About Me
I'm a C# developer with 6 years of experience.
I like to work by myself to have full control over my projects.

# Projects
I had a lot of projects in the past, but I'll only add the newer ones here:
- OFX-Launcher: A custom minecraft launcher made using c# and js
- LScript: My own scripting language
- OCLib: C# Networking library
